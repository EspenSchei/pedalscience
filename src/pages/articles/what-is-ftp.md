# What Is FTP and Why It Matters for Training

FTP (Functional Threshold Power) is the most useful number in cycling training because it anchors your zones. It tells you roughly how hard you can go for about an hour and helps you target the right intensity for every workout.

If you have ever wondered why one ride feels productive and another feels like random suffering, FTP is usually the missing piece.

  <p>FTP is the highest power you can sustain for about 40–60 minutes. It is a practical training benchmark, not a perfect physiological limit.</p>

## Why FTP matters

FTP gives you three things:

- A way to set **training zones** that match your current fitness
- A way to **track progress** over time
- A way to **pace long efforts** without blowing up

When your FTP is accurate, workouts feel “hard but doable.” When it is off, everything feels wrong.

## How FTP is tested

Most riders use one of these tests:

| Test type | How it works | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20-minute test | All-out 20 minutes × 0.95 | Accurate for steady riders | Mentally hard, needs pacing |
| Ramp test | Short ramp to failure × 0.75 | Easy to do | Can overestimate for punchy riders |
| 8-minute test | 2×8 minutes × 0.90 | Shorter & repeatable | Less common, more variable |

The best test is the one you will repeat consistently.

<div class="callout callout-tip">
  <p class="callout-title">Simple rule</p>
  <p>Re-test every 4–8 weeks, or after a training block, so your zones stay accurate.</p>
</div>

## How to use FTP in training

Once you have FTP, you can use zones with purpose:

- **Zone 2** builds aerobic base and endurance
- **Sweet Spot** (just below FTP) builds fitness efficiently
- **Threshold** intervals build sustained power
- **VO2max** intervals raise your aerobic ceiling

If you are training 5–8 hours per week, sweet spot and threshold sessions are often the most effective use of time.

## Common FTP mistakes

- Testing on a bad day and then training off a low number
- Using a ramp test that inflates FTP, making intervals too hard
- Never updating FTP after gaining fitness

## The bottom line

FTP is not perfect, but it is incredibly useful. It turns random riding into a plan and makes progress measurable.
