# Tapering for Cycling Races: How to Rest Without Getting Slower

Tapering is the art of showing up fresh without losing fitness. Done well, it can add several percent to performance, which is huge. Done poorly, it feels like you got lazy and flat.

Here is what the research says and how to apply it as a cyclist.

## The evidence in one sentence

Meta-analyses on tapering show that reducing training volume while keeping intensity leads to meaningful performance gains in endurance athletes. The key is to keep intensity, cut volume, and allow fatigue to dissipate.

## How much to cut

A common evidence-based approach is:

- **Reduce volume by 40-60%**
- **Maintain intensity** (keep short hard efforts)
- **Keep frequency similar** (do not disappear from the bike)

This combination consistently improves time-trial performance and time-to-exhaustion across endurance sports.

| Taper length | Best for | Typical volume cut |
|---|---|---|
| 5-7 days | Short events | 40-50% |
| 7-10 days | Most races | 40-60% |
| 10-14 days | Long events | 50-60% |

## When to start your taper

Most cyclists do well with:

- **7-14 days** for longer events (gran fondos, stage races)
- **5-7 days** for shorter races (TTs, criteriums)

If you are older or carrying more fatigue, lean toward the longer end.

## Two taper styles that work

**1) Step taper**  
Cut volume sharply at the start, then keep it steady. Simple and effective.

**2) Progressive taper**  
Reduce volume gradually across the week. Often feels more natural if you dislike abrupt changes.

Both approaches can work. The key is keeping some short, hard efforts so your nervous system stays sharp.

## A 14-day taper for long events

If your event is long or you are carrying a lot of fatigue, a two-week taper can feel better.

- **Days 14-10:** Reduce volume by about 30%, keep one quality session
- **Days 9-6:** Reduce volume by 40-50%, keep one short intensity session
- **Days 5-3:** Mostly easy riding with brief openers
- **Days 2-1:** Very light spins or rest

## What a 7-day taper can look like

- **Day 7-6:** Easy endurance rides with a few short openers
- **Day 5:** One quality session (short intervals at race intensity)
- **Day 4-3:** Easy rides only
- **Day 2:** Very short opener ride
- **Day 1:** Rest or a 30-minute easy spin
- **Race day:** Go

## How to taper strength training

If you lift, taper that too. Heavy lifting in race week can leave you heavy-legged.

- 7-10 days out: last moderate strength session
- Race week: one short maintenance session or none at all

You will not lose strength in a week, but you can feel fresher.

## What to avoid

- **Cutting intensity entirely.** This can make you feel flat.
- **Over-resting.** Too many full rest days can reduce sharpness.
- **Last-minute hero workouts.** You cannot build fitness in the final week.

## Signs your taper is on track

- Legs feel springy on short efforts
- Heart rate responds quickly to surges
- You are slightly restless instead of sluggish

## FAQ

**Should I cut carbs during taper?**  
No. This is the time to top up glycogen. Fueling well helps you feel sharp and ready.

**Can I do a hard group ride in taper week?**  
Only if it is short and controlled. A chaotic group ride can create too much fatigue.

## How it should feel

A good taper feels like the training is easy but your legs are poppy. You should feel slightly restless. That is a sign that fatigue is fading and freshness is rising.

## Bottom line

Tapering works. Reduce volume, keep intensity, keep frequency, and start 7-14 days out depending on your event and fatigue level. You will likely show up faster.
