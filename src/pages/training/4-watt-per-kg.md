# 🚴‍♂️ The Road to 4 W/kg

4 W/kg has become a kind of magic threshold in the road cycling community.  
It sounds brutal – but for a regular recreational cyclist with a job, family, and some structure to their sessions, it's actually not unrealistic.

This guide is *short, concrete, and practical*. No bullshit, no 40-page PDF.

  <p class="callout-title">TIP</p>
  <p>The fastest path to 4 W/kg isn't more hero sessions – it's training easy Z2 a bit more often than most people bother to.</p>
</div>

## 🔢 What does 4 W/kg mean in practice?

To get close, it's all about the ratio between **FTP** and **body weight**.

- **75 kg rider → FTP around 300 W**
- **85 kg rider → FTP around 340 W**
- **65 kg rider → FTP around 260 W**

Feel free to use the **[FTP Calculator](/verktoy/ftp-kalkulator)** on this site to check your own zones before you start.

## 🧱 Volume vs intensity (rough overview)

> **Rough picture of what builds 4 W/kg**
>
> **Volume (easy Z2):** about 60–70% of the time  
> **Structured intensity (Z3–Z5):** about 20–30%  
> **"Play on the bike" / spontaneous:** the rest
>
> The point is: easy volume + a few good hard sessions = progress.

## 💡 The three big principles

### 1. **Volume first. Fancy stuff later.**

Most recreational cyclists jump straight to intervals.  
It's actually *Z2 volume* that builds the foundation.

3–5 hours a week of easy zone 2 gives more than all the "hero sessions" in the world.

### 2. **1–2 quality sessions a week is enough**

Anything more is a luxury.

Typical setup:

- one **sweet spot/threshold session**
- one **VO₂max session** (3–5 min efforts)
- the rest: **easy**

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 3×10 min threshold</p>
  <p class="session-meta">THRESHOLD / Z4</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zone:</strong> Z4 (around FTP)</li>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> 3×10 min work, 4–5 min easy between efforts</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> steady watts throughout, don't sprint the first minute</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 4×4 min VO₂max</p>
  <p class="session-meta">HARD / Z5</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Zone:</strong> Z5 (above FTP, around 110–120%)</li>
    <li><strong>Structure:</strong> 4×4 min hard, 3–4 min easy between efforts</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> high but controllable breathing – you should be tired but not blown after the first effort</li>
  </ul>
</div>

If you're training more than the pros rest – something's wrong 😅

### 3. **Progression > Perfection**

You don't need perfect sessions.  
You need sessions that get *a bit better* over time:

- a few more watts
- one more effort
- slightly longer efforts
- slightly lower heart rate at the same power

That's all.

## 🧠 Rest is a superpower

Sleep, stress, and life in general affect your sessions more than power numbers.

Feeling run down?  
Skip the intensity and do a Z1/Z2 session or take full rest.

Recreational cyclists get stronger through **consistency**, not by dying on every interval.

## 📅 Weekly example: 4–6 h/week in practice

> ### Example week toward 4 W/kg _(4–6 hours)_
>
> **Monday:** Off or 30–45 min very easy (Z1/Z2)  
> **Tuesday:** Quality session 1 – e.g. 3×10 min around threshold (Z4)  
> **Wednesday:** Easy Z2, 60–90 min  
> **Thursday:** Quality session 2 – e.g. 4×4 min VO₂max (Z5)  
> **Friday:** Off  
> **Saturday:** Easy long ride 2–3 hours in Z2  
> **Sunday:** Either off, or easy spin 45–60 min if you like to "shake out the legs"
>
> Adjust volumes and number of efforts based on how you feel. The key is to recognize when you're tired – then it's better to skip a hard session than to chase numbers.

This isn't **magic** – it's structure. And structure is what works best for recreational cyclists.

## ⚙️ How to use the tools on this site?

1. Use the **[FTP Calculator](/verktoy/ftp-kalkulator)** to get precise training zones.
2. Plan your sessions so that:
   - easy = *actually easy* (Z1/Z2)
   - hard = *properly hard* (Z4/Z5)
3. Stick to the plan for 3–4 weeks before adjusting.

## 🚀 What you can expect

If you give this 8–12 weeks with consistent training and some progression, you'll notice:

- lower heart rate at the same power
- more minutes at threshold without collapsing
- higher average power on efforts
- better "everyday feeling" in your legs

And suddenly you're closer to 4 W/kg than you thought 🚴‍♂️🔥
