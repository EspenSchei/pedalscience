# How to Reach 4 W/kg FTP

4 W/kg has become a milestone in the cycling community – a marker of "serious" fitness that opens up new terrain and group ride possibilities. But is it realistic for someone with a job, family, and limited training time?

**The answer is yes** – with the right approach. This guide is based on current sports science, including research from Stephen Seiler on polarized training and the importance of low-intensity volume. For a deeper dive, see **[Polarized vs Pyramidal vs Sweet Spot](/articles/polarized-vs-pyramidal)**.

<div class="callout callout-tip">
  <p class="callout-title">KEY INSIGHT</p>
  <p>Research shows that 80% of elite endurance athletes' training is done at low intensity (Zone 1-2). Recreational cyclists often do the opposite – too much medium intensity, not enough easy or hard. Fixing this distribution is often the fastest path to improvement.</p>
</div>

## 🔢 What does 4 W/kg mean in practice?

Your power-to-weight ratio is simply **FTP ÷ body weight**:

| Weight | FTP needed for 4 W/kg |
|--------|----------------------|
| 60 kg  | 240 W |
| 70 kg  | 280 W |
| 75 kg  | 300 W |
| 80 kg  | 320 W |
| 85 kg  | 340 W |

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p class="callout-title">PERSPECTIVE</p>
  <p>4 W/kg puts you in approximately the top 10-15% of recreational cyclists. It's achievable for most healthy adults with 1-3 years of consistent training, but genetics, age, and training history all play a role.</p>
</div>

## 📊 The science of training distribution

Research by Seiler (2010) and others has shown that elite endurance athletes typically follow a **polarized** training distribution. If you want to compare models, read **[Polarized vs Pyramidal vs Sweet Spot](/articles/polarized-vs-pyramidal)**:

> **The 80/20 principle:**
> - **~80% low intensity** (Zone 1-2, easy conversation possible)
> - **~20% high intensity** (Zone 4-5, hard to very hard)
> - **Minimize Zone 3** ("grey zone" – too hard to recover from, too easy to stimulate adaptation)

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <p class="callout-title">IMPORTANT CONTEXT</p>
  <p>The polarized training research was conducted on athletes training 15-25+ hours per week. At high volumes, Zone 3 work accumulates excessive fatigue without proportional benefit. But for recreational cyclists training 5-10 hours per week, the equation is different.</p>
</div>

### When does polarized (80/20) make sense?

| Weekly volume | Recommended approach |
|--------------|---------------------|
| 12+ hours | Polarized (80/20) works well – plenty of Z2 volume to build base |
| 8-12 hours | Hybrid approach – mostly polarized with some sweet spot |
| 5-8 hours | Sweet spot emphasis – maximizes limited training time |
| Under 5 hours | Focus on consistency; any structured training helps |

### The case for sweet spot at lower volumes

When you can only train 5-8 hours per week:
- You can't accumulate enough Z2 volume to fully develop your aerobic base
- Sweet spot (88-94% FTP) provides strong aerobic stimulus in less time
- Recovery cost is manageable with 48+ hours between hard sessions
- The "grey zone" problem is less relevant because total training load is lower

**Bottom line:** If you're training 10+ hours weekly, lean toward polarized. Under 8 hours, sweet spot becomes your friend. See our [Sweet Spot Training Guide](/training/sweet-spot-progression) for a complete program.

## 💡 The four key principles

### 1. **Build your aerobic base first**

Zone 2 training develops:
- **Mitochondrial density** – more cellular powerhouses
- **Capillarization** – better oxygen delivery to muscles
- **Fat oxidation** – improved fuel efficiency
- **Cardiac output** – stronger, more efficient heart

For time-crunched athletes, aim for **4-6 hours per week** of Zone 2. More is better, but consistency matters more than volume.

### 2. **Make hard days hard, easy days easy**

The biggest mistake recreational cyclists make is riding at "medium" intensity too often. This:
- Creates too much fatigue to recover properly
- Isn't hard enough to drive significant adaptation
- Erodes your aerobic base over time

**Solution:** Keep easy rides truly easy (Zone 1-2, able to hold a conversation), and make quality sessions properly challenging.

### 3. **1-2 high-intensity sessions per week is optimal**

Research shows diminishing returns beyond 2 high-intensity sessions per week for most athletes. Quality over quantity.

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: Threshold intervals (3×10 min)</p>
  <p class="session-meta">ZONE 4 / 95-105% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Warm-up:</strong> 15-20 min progressive</li>
    <li><strong>Work:</strong> 3×10 min at 95-105% FTP</li>
    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> 5 min easy spinning between intervals</li>
    <li><strong>Cool-down:</strong> 10 min easy</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Steady power, controlled breathing, finish feeling like you could do one more</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: VO₂max intervals (5×4 min)</p>
  <p class="session-meta">ZONE 5 / 106-120% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Warm-up:</strong> 15-20 min with 2-3 short openers</li>
    <li><strong>Work:</strong> 5×4 min at 106-120% FTP</li>
    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> 4 min easy spinning between intervals</li>
    <li><strong>Cool-down:</strong> 10 min easy</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Breathing hard but controlled. RPE 8-9/10. Should feel difficult but completable.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### 4. **Prioritize recovery and consistency**

Adaptations happen during recovery, not during training. Sleep, nutrition, and stress management are as important as the training itself.

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <p class="callout-title">WARNING SIGNS OF OVERTRAINING</p>
  <p>Elevated resting heart rate, poor sleep, persistent fatigue, decreased motivation, getting sick frequently, declining performance despite training. If you notice these, take extra rest days.</p>
</div>

## 📅 Sample Training Weeks

Here are two practical weekly structures based on available training time. Choose the one that fits your life.

### Option A: Time-Crunched (5-7 hours/week) – Sweet Spot Focus

Best for riders who can only train 5-7 hours. Maximizes adaptation with limited time.

| Day | Session | Duration | Intensity |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|
| Monday | Rest | - | - |
| Tuesday | **Sweet Spot** (2×20 min) | 60-75 min | 88-94% FTP |
| Wednesday | Easy spin or rest | 0-45 min | Z1-Z2 |
| Thursday | **VO₂max intervals** (4×4 min) | 60 min | 106-120% FTP |
| Friday | Rest | - | - |
| Saturday | Long endurance ride | 2-2.5 hours | Z2 |
| Sunday | Easy recovery or rest | 0-45 min | Z1 |

**Weekly totals:** ~5-7 hours, 2 quality sessions

<div class="callout callout-tip">
  <p class="callout-title">WHY SWEET SPOT HERE?</p>
  <p>At this volume, you can't accumulate enough Z2 time to fully develop your aerobic base. Sweet spot gives you more training stimulus per hour, making it ideal for time-crunched schedules.</p>
</div>

### Option B: More Available Time (8-12 hours/week) – Polarized Focus

Best for riders who can train 8+ hours. Follows the 80/20 polarized distribution.

| Day | Session | Duration | Intensity |
|-----|---------|----------|-----------|
| Monday | Rest or easy spin | 0-45 min | Z1 |
| Tuesday | **Threshold intervals** (3×10 min) | 75 min | 95-105% FTP |
| Wednesday | Easy endurance | 75-90 min | Z2 |
| Thursday | **VO₂max intervals** (5×4 min) | 60-75 min | 106-120% FTP |
| Friday | Rest | - | - |
| Saturday | Long ride | 3-4 hours | Z2 |
| Sunday | Easy endurance | 60-90 min | Z1-Z2 |

**Weekly totals:** ~8-12 hours, 2 quality sessions, ~80% low intensity

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p class="callout-title">THE 80/20 ADVANTAGE</p>
  <p>With more volume, you can build a proper aerobic base through Z2 riding. The two hard sessions provide the high-intensity stimulus, while easy volume does the heavy lifting for mitochondrial development.</p>
</div>

### Key principles for both approaches

1. **Never do hard sessions on consecutive days** – minimum 48 hours between intensity
2. **Easy means easy** – Z1/Z2, conversation pace, don't let ego push you harder
3. **Be flexible** – swap days as needed, but protect your quality sessions
4. **Listen to fatigue** – if you're exhausted, convert a hard day to easy

## 📈 What to expect over time

With consistent training following these principles:

| Timeline | Expected changes |
|----------|------------------|
| 4-6 weeks | Lower heart rate at same power, better recovery between sessions |
| 8-12 weeks | Measurable FTP increase (typically 3-8%), improved endurance |
| 6 months | Significant fitness gains, approaching or reaching goal |
| 1-2 years | Full potential realization with continued consistency |
