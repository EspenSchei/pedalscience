# ⚡ Sweet Spot Progression for Recreational Cyclists

Sweet spot is one of the most effective tools for recreational cyclists who want to build FTP and endurance without being worn out by heavy threshold sessions or acid baths at VO₂max. It's simply an ideal balance between effectiveness and load.

Properly dosed, sweet spot provides:

- high aerobic development
- solid muscular endurance
- very good "time efficiency"
- less fatigue than classic Z4 sessions
- faster recovery than Z5 sessions

<div class="callout callout-info">
  <p class="callout-title">INFO</p>
  <p>Sweet spot typically lies around 88–94% of FTP. High enough to give progress, low enough to be built week by week.</p>
</div>

## 🧠 How should sweet spot feel?

A good sweet spot session should be:

- controlled
- stable
- heavy, but manageable
- with relatively steady breathing
- possible to complete without drama

It should NOT feel like a threshold battle.

<div class="callout callout-warning">
  <p class="callout-title">WARNING</p>
  <p>If you're completely finished after the efforts, you've probably been training in the threshold zone and not sweet spot.</p>
</div>

## 🧱 The most important rule for progression

> **Increase the volume – not the intensity.**

Sweet spot works best when intensity is kept stable, while you gradually:

- increase effort length
- increase number of efforts
- increase total time in sweet spot

This gives **sustainable** progression without overload.

## 🗺️ Recommended progression (4–8 weeks)

This is a simple framework that suits most recreational cyclists.

### **Week 1–2: Easy entry**
<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 3×10 min sweet spot</p>
  <p class="session-meta">88–92% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> 4–5 min</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> find the rhythm and technique</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### **Week 3–4: More time in the same zone**
<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 2×15 min sweet spot</p>
  <p class="session-meta">88–92% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> 5 min</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> stable power and controlled heart rate</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### **Week 5–6: Increased capacity**
<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 3×12 min sweet spot</p>
  <p class="session-meta">88–93% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> 4 min</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> steady work without tipping into threshold</li>
  </ul>
</div>

### **Week 7–8: Classic FTP builder**
<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Session: 2×20 min sweet spot</p>
  <p class="session-meta">90–94% FTP</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Rest:</strong> 5 min</li>
    <li><strong>Goal:</strong> calm, focused work over time</li>
  </ul>
</div>

This setup gives solid results for most people.

## 🔥 Alternative progression (for short weekday sessions)

For riders who often have 45–75 minutes available on weekdays, smaller, more frequent efforts can work even better:

### Progression with short, repeatable efforts
<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Week 1–2</p>
  <p class="session-meta">3×10 min</p>
</div>

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Week 3–4</p>
  <p class="session-meta">3×12 min</p>
</div>

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Week 5–6</p>
  <p class="session-meta">4×10 min</p>
</div>

<div class="session-box">
  <p class="session-title">Week 7–8</p>
  <p class="session-meta">4×12 min</p>
</div>

This gives high total work time and very predictable sessions.

## 🧪 How do you know sweet spot is working?

Look for these signs:

- lower heart rate at the same power
- less discomfort in long efforts
- better control and technique
- fewer breaks
- smoother pedaling
- the feeling that sweet spot becomes "comfortably difficult"

<div class="callout callout-success">
  <p class="callout-title">SUCCESS</p>
  <p>When you can hold sweet spot with lower heart rate and better control than before – FTP is on its way up.</p>
</div>

## ⚙️ How to use the tools on this site?

For best control:

- use the **[FTP Calculator](/tools/ftp-calculator)** to ensure correct intensity
- use the **Speed/Watts Calculator** to see effect on flat terrain
- use the **Climb Calculator** to track time improvements on hills

---

## 🚀 Summary

Sweet spot is one of the most effective tools for recreational cyclists who want progress in:

- FTP
- endurance
- climbing
- control
- work over time

The key is:

- stable intensity
- gradual increase in work time
- few, but good sessions
- continuity over time

Follow the principles in this guide for 6–10 weeks, and you'll likely see both measurable and noticeable improvements.
